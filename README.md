### Components
1. Maximized usage of React Hooks.
2. Borrowed some of the custom hooks / utils.
3. Assumed that we have to build our components on our own. No 3rd party installation except for styling components and dialog.

### Requirements
1. Assumed some of the measurement values (padding, margin, etc.)
2. To fulfill the column headers and ID should always visible, used a `sticky` position to table headers.
